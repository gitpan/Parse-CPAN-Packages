DESCRIPTION
    The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful
    collection of Perl code. It has several indices of the files that it
    hosts, including a file named "02packages.details.txt.gz" in the
    "modules" directory. This file contains lots of useful information and
    this module provides a simple interface to the data contained within.

    Note that this module does not concern itself with downloading or
    unpacking this file. You should do this yourself.

    The constructor takes the path to the 02packages.details.txt file. It
    defaults to loading the file from the current directory.

    In a future release Parse::CPAN::Packages::Package and
    Parse::CPAN::Packages::Distribution might have more information.
